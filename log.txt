VUID-VkInstanceCreateInfo-pNext-pNext(ERROR / SPEC): msgNum: -1337267667 - Validation Error: [ VUID-VkInstanceCreateInfo-pNext-pNext ] | MessageID = 0xb04aea2d | vkCreateInstance(): pCreateInfo->pNext chain includes a structure with unexpected VkStructureType VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_APPLICATION_INFO. This error is based on the Valid Usage documentation for version 290 of the Vulkan header.  It is possible that you are using a struct from a private extension or an extension that was added to a later version of the Vulkan header, in which case the use of pCreateInfo->pNext is undefined and may not work correctly with validation enabled. The Vulkan spec states: Each pNext member of any structure (including this one) in the pNext chain must be either NULL or a pointer to a valid instance of VkDebugReportCallbackCreateInfoEXT, VkDebugUtilsMessengerCreateInfoEXT, VkDirectDriverLoadingListLUNARG, VkExportMetalObjectCreateInfoEXT, VkLayerSettingsCreateInfoEXT, VkValidationFeaturesEXT, or VkValidationFlagsEXT (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.3.290.0/windows/1.3-extensions/vkspec.html#VUID-VkInstanceCreateInfo-pNext-pNext)

VUID-VkInstanceCreateInfo-sType-unique(ERROR / SPEC): msgNum: 1022380920 - Validation Error: [ VUID-VkInstanceCreateInfo-sType-unique ] | MessageID = 0x3cf04b78 | vkCreateInstance(): pCreateInfo->pNext chain contains duplicate structure types: VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_APPLICATION_INFO appears multiple times. The Vulkan spec states: The sType value of each struct in the pNext chain must be unique, with the exception of structures of type VkDebugUtilsMessengerCreateInfoEXT, VkExportMetalObjectCreateInfoEXT, or VkLayerSettingsCreateInfoEXT (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.3.290.0/windows/1.3-extensions/vkspec.html#VUID-VkInstanceCreateInfo-sType-unique)
